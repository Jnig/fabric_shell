A very simple function to get a fabric shell. More to come when I have time for it. 

Example usage if shell.py is in the same directory as your fabfile.py

    from fabric.api import *
    from fabric.decorators import hosts
     
    import shell
    
    env.hosts = [
         'host1.domain.com',
         'host2.domain.com'
    ]

    @hosts('')
    def cmd():
        shell.shell()
